- **Adoption Barriers**: Simple onboarding process

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain 80% test coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Conduct code reviews
- Document complex logic

### Database Migration Guidelines

#### Migration Best Practices
- **Naming Convention**: Use timestamp prefix `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`
- **Atomic Migrations**: Each migration should be a single logical change
- **Reversible**: Include DOWN migrations for rollback capability
- **Idempotent**: Migrations should be safe to run multiple times
- **Tested**: Test migrations on local database before committing

#### Migration Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Create new migration
   pnpm migrate:create add_recipe_nutrition
   
   # Apply pending migrations
   pnpm migrate:up
   
   # Check migration status
   pnpm migrate:status
   
   # Rollback last migration
   pnpm migrate:down
   ```

2. **Build Integration**
   ```json
   // package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "npm run migrate:up && next build",
       "migrate:create": "supabase migration new",
       "migrate:up": "node scripts/run-migrations.js",
       "migrate:down": "node scripts/rollback-migration.js",
       "migrate:status": "node scripts/check-migrations.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Migration Tracking**
   - Migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations` table
   - Each migration records: filename, checksum, applied_at
   - Build process checks for unapplied migrations
   - Prevents duplicate migration application

4. **Type Generation**
   ```bash
   # After migrations, regenerate types
   pnpm generate:types
   ```

5. **CI/CD Integration**

## Summary & Recommendations

### Current Project State (January 2025)
The Recipe Inheritance Keeper has successfully implemented core functionality exceeding the original MVP scope:
- ✅ Complete recipe management system with CRUD operations
- ✅ Advanced OCR with handwriting recognition
- ✅ Voice-to-recipe creation and updates with real-time transcription (beyond original scope)
- ✅ Version tracking with full history including UI diff viewer
- ✅ Authentication with protected routes and demo mode
- ✅ Responsive UI with beautiful print support including photos
- ✅ Favorites system with optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Development tooling with health monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (292 tests passing)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Tags UI** - Backend is ready, just needs frontend implementation
2. **Implement E2E Testing** with Playwright/Cypress for quality assurance
3. **Add Recipe Tools** (scaling, conversion, shopping lists) for better cooking experience
4. **Enable Sharing & Export** to fulfill the core mission of recipe preservation
5. **Advanced Search Features** - Ingredient search, filters, and full-text search

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Focus on Family Features**: Prioritize features that strengthen family connections (stories, collaboration, heritage tracking)
2. **Improve Testing Coverage**: Implement comprehensive E2E and accessibility testing before adding new features
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add monitoring and optimize for larger recipe collections
4. **Mobile Experience**: Consider Progressive Web App (PWA) before native apps
5. **Community Building**: Add family collaboration features to increase engagement

The project has a solid foundation with impressive AI integration. The next phases should focus on completing the planned features while maintaining code quality and user experience.

"You can scan 10 more recipe cards this month"
```

**Voice Recording:**
```
Voice Minutes This Month:
[██████░░░░] 18 of 30 minutes used
"You have 12 minutes of recording left"
```

#### Friendly Notifications

**Getting Close (80% used):**
- "📸 You've scanned 40 recipes this month! You have 10 scans left."
